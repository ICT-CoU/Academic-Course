## Bisection Method
Given a function f(x) on floating number x and two numbers ```a``` and ```b``` such that ```f(a)*f(b) < 0``` and f(x) is continuous in [a, b]. Here f(x) represents algebraic or transcendental equation. Find root of function in interval [a, b]  ( Or find a value of x such that f(x) is 0 ).


**Example: **
 
```
Input: A function of x, for example x3 - x2 + 2.     
       And two values: a = -200 and b = 300 such that
       f(a)*f(b) < 0, i.e., f(a) and f(b) have
       opposite signs.
Output: The value of root is : -1.0025
        OR any other value with allowed
        deviation from root.
```

The method is based on The Intermediate Value Theorem which states that if f(x) is a continuous function and there are two real numbers a and b such that f(a)*f(b) 0 and f(b) < 0), then it is guaranteed that it has at least one root between them.

**Assumptions**: 
 
    1. f(x) is a continuous function in interval [a, b]
    2. f(a) * f(b) < 0


**Steps:**

   1. Find middle point c= (a + b)/2 .
   2. If f(c) == 0, then c is the root of the solution.
   3. Else f(c) != 0
   4. If value f(a)*f(c) < 0 then root lies between a and c. So we recur for a and c
   5. Else If f(b)*f(c) < 0 then root lies between b and c. So we recur b and c.
   6. Else given function doesnâ€™t follow one of assumptions.
